The *Comments* App
==================

.. warning::
	This app may be removed in a further version in favor of Django's ``contrib.comments``. I'll have a look at this and will then decide if the ``contrib.comments`` are good enough for Conescy.

The Idea
--------

- generic
- one row
- spam protection made easy

The Model
---------

.. autoclass:: conescy.apps.comments.models.Comment

The Views
---------

.. automodule:: conescy.apps.comments.views
